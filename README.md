# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This project is part of the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course. The purpose is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Dataset

The data used in this project is from the [UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones).

## Files

- `run_analysis.R`: R script that performs the data cleaning and transformation.
- `tidy_dataset.txt`: Output file containing the tidy dataset.
- `CodeBook.md`: Describes the variables and transformations.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run

1. Download the dataset from the UCI repository.
2. Place the dataset in your working directory.
3. Run the `run_analysis.R` script in RStudio or R console.
4. The script will output `tidy_dataset.txt` in your working directory.

## Output

The final tidy dataset contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
